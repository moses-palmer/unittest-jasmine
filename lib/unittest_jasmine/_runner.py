    Each event is a ``dict`` and has the keys ``event``, which is the event
    type, and ``data``, which is data associated with the event.

    The event names correspond to the *Jasmine* reporter callback methods, and
    the data to their data argument. Please see ``./runner.js`` and the
    *Jasmine* documentation and source code for more information.

        either the base directory of the project, or the actual path to the
        spec files. If set to the project directory, ``options`` must contain
        the value ``'spec_dir'``, which is the relative path to the spec files.

    :param [str] files: The spec files. These paths must be relative to
        ``project_dir`` and, if specified, ``options['spec_dir']``.

        is sent to ``Jasmine.loadConfig``.
