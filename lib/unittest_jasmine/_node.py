This module tries to determine the command used to launch ``node`` on the
current system.

Since node.js picked an already used binary name, we must check whether
``node`` is *node.js* or *node - Amateur Packet Radio Node program*. The latter
is the case on some *Debian* based systems.

If no suitable executable is found, ``ImportError`` is raised.
